**A plumbing emergency doesn't wait for convenient timing. Here's how to minimize damage while help is on the way.**

## The First 5 Minutes Matter Most

When water is spraying, sewage is backing up, or your water heater is making alarming sounds, panic is understandable. But the actions you take in the first few minutes can mean the difference between minor damage and thousands of dollars in repairs.

This guide covers the immediate steps you should take in common plumbing emergencies—before the plumber arrives.

## Universal First Step: Know Your Shut-Off Valves

Before any emergency happens, locate these critical shut-offs:

### Main Water Shut-Off

This stops all water to your home. In Phoenix-area homes, it's typically:

- **Near the front of the house** – In a ground-level box near the street (meter box) or on an exterior wall
- **In the garage** – Often near the water heater
- **Inside a utility closet** – In some newer construction

**How to operate:**
- Gate valve: Turn clockwise until fully closed (may require multiple turns)
- Ball valve: Turn handle 90 degrees until perpendicular to pipe
- Meter box: Use a meter key or adjustable wrench on the street-side valve

**Pro tip:** Test your main shut-off valve once a year. Valves that sit unused can seize or fail when you need them most.

### Water Heater Shut-Off

Located on the cold water inlet pipe above the water heater. Shutting this off stops flow to and from the water heater without affecting cold water to the rest of the house.

### Individual Fixture Shut-Offs

Most fixtures have local shut-off valves:
- **Toilets:** Oval valve on the wall behind the toilet
- **Sinks:** Under the sink, usually two valves (hot and cold)
- **Washing machine:** Behind the washer, usually red and blue handles

## Emergency: Burst Pipe or Major Leak

### Immediate Steps

1. **Shut off the main water supply** – Don't waste time finding the individual valve
2. **Turn off the water heater** – Prevents damage to the unit if it runs dry
3. **Open faucets** – Drains remaining water from pipes and relieves pressure
4. **Locate the breach** – Once water stops flowing, identify where the leak is

### Damage Control

- **Move belongings** away from water
- **Use towels and buckets** to contain spreading water
- **Open windows and run fans** to start drying
- **Take photos** for insurance documentation

### What NOT to Do

- Don't try to patch a burst pipe with tape or epoxy—it won't hold under pressure
- Don't turn water back on to "test" the repair
- Don't ignore a small leak—they become big leaks

### Call Priority: EMERGENCY

A burst pipe is a true emergency. Call immediately—water damage compounds quickly.

## Emergency: Sewer Backup

### Signs of Sewer Backup

- Water coming up through floor drains
- Sewage in tubs, showers, or toilets
- Multiple drains backing up simultaneously
- Sewage smell throughout the house

### Immediate Steps

1. **Stop using water** – Every flush or drain adds to the backup
2. **Do not use chemical drain cleaners** – They won't help and may make things worse
3. **Keep people and pets away** – Sewage contains harmful bacteria
4. **Turn off HVAC** – Prevents contamination from spreading through ductwork

### Damage Control

- **Don't attempt cleanup** until backup is resolved—more sewage may emerge
- **Ventilate the area** by opening windows (if safe to do so)
- **Document the damage** with photos and video

### Health Precautions

Sewage backup is a biohazard. If you must be in the affected area:
- Wear rubber boots and gloves
- Avoid direct contact with sewage water
- Wash thoroughly if contact occurs
- Don't eat or drink in the affected area

### Call Priority: EMERGENCY

Sewage backup requires immediate professional response. This is a health hazard and will get worse until resolved.

## Emergency: No Hot Water

### Diagnose the Situation

**Gas water heater:**
- Is the pilot light on?
- Is the gas valve in the "on" position?
- Do other gas appliances work?

**Electric water heater:**
- Is the breaker tripped?
- Have you tried the reset button?

### Immediate Steps

**For gas heaters with no pilot:**
1. Follow the relighting instructions on the unit label
2. If the pilot won't stay lit after 2-3 attempts, stop trying
3. If you smell gas, leave the house and call the gas company

**For electric heaters with tripped breaker:**
1. Reset the breaker fully (off, then on)
2. If it trips again immediately, don't keep resetting—there's an electrical issue

**For both types:**
- Check the temperature setting—someone may have adjusted it
- Check for visible water leaks around the base

### Call Priority: URGENT (same-day) but not emergency

No hot water is uncomfortable but not dangerous. Unless you smell gas or see water damage, this can wait a few hours for scheduled service.

## Emergency: Clogged Toilet (Overflowing)

### Immediate Steps

1. **Remove the tank lid** and push down on the flapper valve to stop water flow
2. **Turn off the water supply** at the valve behind the toilet
3. **Do not flush again**—this adds more water
4. **Wait** for water level to drop

### Try a Plunger (The Right Way)

1. Use a flange plunger (one with an extended rubber flap)
2. Create a seal over the drain opening
3. Plunge with steady, forceful strokes—15-20 times
4. Pour a gallon of water into the bowl to test (don't flush yet)
5. If water drains normally, try a full flush

### If Plunging Doesn't Work

- Do not pour drain cleaner into the toilet—it doesn't work on toilet clogs and can damage the bowl
- Do not attempt to fish out the clog with wire hangers—you can scratch the porcelain
- A closet auger (toilet snake) is the next step, but improper use can damage the toilet

### Call Priority: STANDARD (can often wait until next business day)

A single clogged toilet is inconvenient but not urgent unless it's your only bathroom.

## Emergency: Gas Smell

### This is a Life-Safety Emergency

If you smell gas (rotten egg odor):

1. **Do not turn on/off any electrical switches**—sparks can ignite gas
2. **Do not light any flames** or create any spark
3. **Open windows** if easily accessible while leaving
4. **Leave the house immediately** with all occupants
5. **Call the gas company** from outside or a neighbor's house
6. **Don't re-enter** until gas company gives the all-clear

### Gas Company Emergency Numbers

- Southwest Gas: 1-877-860-6020
- Most gas leaks are handled by the gas company at no charge

### Call Priority: LIFE-SAFETY EMERGENCY

Gas leaks can cause explosions. This takes precedence over all other concerns.

## Emergency: Water Heater Leaking

### Identify the Leak Source

**From the top:**
- Often a supply line connection—may be tightened or replaced
- Check the anode rod fitting
- Check T&P valve discharge tube

**From the bottom:**
- Could be condensation (not always serious)
- Could be a failed tank (serious—replacement needed)
- Could be the drain valve leaking

**From the T&P relief valve:**
- If valve is discharging, there's a pressure or temperature problem
- Do not cap or plug this valve—it's a safety device

### Immediate Steps

1. **Turn off the water supply** to the water heater
2. **Turn off the power source:**
   - Gas: Turn knob to "off"
   - Electric: Turn off breaker
3. **Attach a hose** to the drain valve if the tank is leaking from the bottom
4. **Place towels or a pan** under the leak to contain water

### Call Priority: URGENT

A leaking water heater should be addressed same-day. A tank leak typically means replacement is needed.

## Emergency: Frozen Pipes

### Signs of Frozen Pipes

- No water comes out when you turn on a faucet
- Frost visible on exposed pipes
- Strange smells from drains (ice blocking the line)

### Immediate Steps

1. **Keep the faucet open** – Running water helps thaw the pipe
2. **Apply gentle heat** to the frozen section:
   - Hair dryer
   - Heat lamp
   - Warm towels
   - Space heater (kept away from anything flammable)
3. **Start heating from the faucet end** and work back toward the frozen section

### What NOT to Do

- Never use an open flame (torch, lighter, etc.)
- Never use a heat gun on high settings
- Never leave heat source unattended

### Call Priority: URGENT

Frozen pipes can burst when they thaw. If you can't locate the freeze or aren't comfortable thawing it, call for same-day service.

## Emergency: Running Toilet

### Why It Matters

A running toilet wastes 200+ gallons daily and can significantly increase your water bill.

### Quick Fix Attempts

1. **Jiggle the handle** – Sometimes the flapper is stuck
2. **Check the flapper seal** – Lift the flapper and see if water stops
3. **Adjust the float** – If water level is too high, lower the float setting
4. **Check the fill tube** – Make sure it's connected and not spraying

### Call Priority: STANDARD

A running toilet isn't an emergency. It can typically wait for scheduled service, but don't ignore it—the water waste adds up.
