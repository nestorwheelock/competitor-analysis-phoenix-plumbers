# When to Call a Plumber vs DIY: A Homeowner's Guide

**Some plumbing jobs are perfect for DIY. Others will cost you more if you try them yourself. Here's how to tell the difference.**

## The DIY Decision Framework

Every plumbing issue falls somewhere on a spectrum from "anyone can handle this" to "this requires professional expertise." The key is knowing where your problem sits before you start.

**Consider these factors:**

1. **Safety risk** – Does this involve gas, electricity, or hazardous materials?
2. **Damage potential** – What's the worst that can happen if you make a mistake?
3. **Tool requirements** – Do you have (or can you rent) what's needed?
4. **Skill level** – Have you done similar work before?
5. **Time value** – Is your time worth more than the service call?
6. **Permit requirements** – Does the work require inspection?

Let's break down common plumbing issues into categories.

## Definitely DIY: Low Risk, High Reward

These tasks are straightforward, require basic tools, and have minimal risk of making things worse.

### Plunging a Clogged Toilet or Drain

**What you need:** A quality plunger (flange style for toilets, cup style for sinks)

**The technique:**
1. Ensure enough water to cover the plunger cup
2. Create a seal over the drain opening
3. Plunge with steady, firm strokes (15-20 times)
4. Pull sharply on the final stroke
5. Repeat if needed

**When to stop and call:** If 5-10 minutes of plunging doesn't clear the clog, there's a deeper obstruction.

### Replacing a Toilet Flapper

**Signs you need this:** Toilet runs constantly or ghost flushes

**What you need:** New flapper ($5-$15), available at any hardware store

**The process:**
1. Turn off water at the valve behind the toilet
2. Flush to empty the tank
3. Remove old flapper from overflow tube and chain
4. Install new flapper, connecting the chain
5. Turn water on and test

**DIY confidence level:** Anyone can do this

### Cleaning Faucet Aerators

**Signs you need this:** Low water pressure at one faucet, uneven spray

**What you need:** Pliers, vinegar, old toothbrush

**The process:**
1. Unscrew aerator from faucet tip (clockwise when looking up at it)
2. Soak in vinegar for 30 minutes
3. Scrub debris with toothbrush
4. Reassemble and reinstall

**DIY confidence level:** Very easy

### Unclogging a Drain with a Hand Snake

**What you need:** Hand drain snake/auger ($15-$30)

**The process:**
1. Remove drain cover or stopper
2. Feed snake into drain until you hit resistance
3. Rotate the handle while pushing
4. Continue until you break through or retrieve the clog
5. Flush with water

**DIY confidence level:** Easy with practice

### Tightening Connections to Stop Minor Drips

**What you need:** Adjustable wrench, plumber's tape

**The process:**
1. Turn off water supply
2. Dry the connection to see exactly where water emerges
3. Tighten the connection gently (1/4 turn at a time)
4. If tightening doesn't work, disconnect, add plumber's tape, reconnect

**DIY confidence level:** Easy

## Probably DIY: Moderate Skill Required

These tasks require more knowledge or tools but are achievable for capable DIYers.

### Replacing a Faucet

**Skill required:** Basic tool use, ability to work in cramped spaces

**What you need:** Basin wrench, adjustable wrench, plumber's putty or silicone, new faucet

**The challenge:** Working under the sink is awkward. Connections can be corroded and difficult to remove.

**When to call instead:** If connections are severely corroded, if you can't get adequate access, or if the water supply lines need replacement.

**DIY confidence level:** Moderate – straightforward but fiddly

### Replacing a Toilet

**Skill required:** Moderate strength (toilets are heavy), attention to detail

**What you need:** New toilet, wax ring, closet bolts, adjustable wrench

**The challenges:**
- Toilets weigh 60-80+ pounds
- The wax ring must seat properly
- The bowl must be level

**When to call instead:** If the flange is damaged, if you have mobility limitations, or if you're not confident about the seal.

**DIY confidence level:** Moderate – physically demanding

### Replacing a Showerhead

**What you need:** Adjustable wrench or pliers, plumber's tape, cloth (to protect finish)

**The process:**
1. Wrap old showerhead connection with cloth
2. Use wrench to unscrew (counterclockwise)
3. Clean threads
4. Wrap new showerhead threads with plumber's tape
5. Hand-tighten new showerhead, then 1/4 turn with wrench

**DIY confidence level:** Easy to moderate

### Replacing a Garbage Disposal

**Skill required:** Electrical safety awareness, ability to work in confined space

**What you need:** New disposal, screwdriver, pliers, possibly wire connectors

**The challenges:**
- Electrical connections (turn off breaker first!)
- Awkward positioning under the sink
- Proper mounting and seal

**When to call instead:** If you're uncomfortable with electrical work, if your existing installation is non-standard, or if the unit doesn't match the existing mount.

**DIY confidence level:** Moderate to challenging

### Fixing a Running Toilet (Beyond the Flapper)

**What's involved:** Replacing fill valve and/or flush valve

**Skill required:** Understanding of toilet mechanics, patience

**The challenges:**
- Multiple components may be involved
- Adjustment can be finicky
- Water supply connection quality matters

**When to call instead:** If the problem persists after replacing obvious parts, or if you're unsure what's causing the issue.

**DIY confidence level:** Moderate

## Probably Call a Pro: Higher Risk or Complexity

These tasks have greater damage potential, require specialized knowledge, or need permits.

### Water Heater Repair or Replacement

**Why hire a pro:**
- Gas connections require expertise (and create explosion risk if done wrong)
- Electrical connections require proper safety knowledge
- Improper installation can cause flooding or fire
- Permits typically required
- Warranty often requires professional installation

**DIY exceptions:** Replacing an anode rod (relatively simple tank maintenance) or lighting a pilot light (following manufacturer instructions).

### Clearing Main Sewer Line

**Why hire a pro:**
- Requires motorized drain machine or hydro jet
- Risk of damaging pipes if done incorrectly
- Risk of sewage exposure (health hazard)
- Camera inspection may be needed to identify cause
- Root intrusion requires specific treatment

**DIY exceptions:** Minor clogs that clear with plunging. Anything beyond that needs professional equipment.

### Fixing Leaks Inside Walls

**Why hire a pro:**
- Locating the leak requires experience (and sometimes specialized equipment)
- Opening walls creates mess and repair requirements
- Wrong diagnosis means opening the wrong wall
- Significant water damage potential

**DIY exceptions:** If the leak location is already obvious and accessible.

### Replacing Shut-Off Valves

**Why hire a pro:**
- Requires main water shut-off at the street
- Older valve removal can be difficult
- Potential for significant water damage if something goes wrong
- Soldering may be required (older homes)

**DIY exceptions:** Replacing a valve under a sink (if compression or push-fit connections) is manageable for capable DIYers.

### Toilet Flange Repair

**Why hire a pro:**
- The flange is below floor level—access is challenging
- Improper repair leads to leaks and floor damage
- May require subfloor work
- Sewer gas exposure possible

**DIY exceptions:** If the flange is fully accessible and not severely damaged.

## Definitely Call a Pro: High Risk, High Skill

These tasks have significant safety implications, code requirements, or damage potential.

### Gas Line Work

**Why this is non-negotiable:**
- Gas leaks cause explosions
- Requires specialized training and tools
- Requires permits and inspection
- Most areas require licensed gas work

**No DIY exceptions.** Even seemingly minor gas work should be done by a professional.

### Repiping (Partial or Whole-House)

**Why hire a pro:**
- Extensive work affecting entire home
- Requires proper sizing and design
- Permits and inspections required
- Significant flooding risk if done wrong
- Insurance implications

**No DIY exceptions.** This is major plumbing work.

### Sewer Line Repair or Replacement

**Why hire a pro:**
- Requires excavation or specialized trenchless equipment
- Complex connections to city sewer
- Permits required
- Grade and slope critical for function
- Significant property damage if done incorrectly

**No DIY exceptions.** Even accessing the line requires professional equipment.

### Water Heater Installation

**Why hire a pro:**
- See above—gas and electrical risks
- Code requirements for installation
- Permits and inspections required
- Warranty requirements
- Liability concerns

**No DIY exceptions.** Installing a water heater yourself saves a few hundred dollars but creates thousands in potential liability.

### Backflow Prevention Device Installation

**Why hire a pro:**
- Protects drinking water supply from contamination
- Requires specific certification in most areas
- Annual testing required
- Code compliance mandatory

**No DIY exceptions.** This is regulatory work.

## The Real Cost of DIY Gone Wrong

DIY plumbing mistakes can be expensive:

| Mistake | Typical Cost to Fix |
|---------|---------------------|
| Overtightened fitting cracks | $100-$300 |
| Improper P-trap installation | $150-$250 |
| Wax ring leak (toilet) | $200-$500 (plus floor damage) |
| Water damage from burst connection | $1,000-$10,000+ |
| Gas leak from DIY work | Priceless (life safety) |
| Code violation discovered at sale | $500-$5,000+ to correct |

Sometimes the cheapest option is paying a professional from the start.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before attempting any plumbing DIY:

1. **What's the worst-case scenario?** Can you live with that outcome?
2. **Do I have the right tools?** Improvising leads to problems.
3. **Is my water shut-off working?** Test it before you need it.
4. **Do I have time to complete this today?** Plumbing half-done is worse than not started.
5. **What's my backup plan?** Can you call someone if this goes wrong?
6. **Does this require a permit?** Unpermitted work creates problems later.

---

## The Bottom Line

DIY plumbing can save money—when you choose the right projects. Focus on low-risk tasks like replacing flappers, clearing simple clogs, and changing faucets. Leave gas work, water heater installation, and major repairs to professionals.

The best DIYers know their limits. There's no shame in calling a professional—and often it's the smarter financial choice.
