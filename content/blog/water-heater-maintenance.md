# Water Heater Maintenance Tips: Extend the Life of Your Unit

**Your water heater works hard every day. A little maintenance goes a long way toward preventing breakdowns and extending its lifespan.**

## Why Water Heater Maintenance Matters

Your water heater is one of the hardest-working appliances in your home. It runs 24/7, heating 40-80 gallons of water to meet your household's demands. In Phoenix's hard water environment, that constant work takes a toll.

**Without maintenance:**
- Sediment accumulates, reducing efficiency
- Heating elements work harder, shortening lifespan
- Anode rod depletes, leaving the tank vulnerable to corrosion
- Minor issues become major failures

**With regular maintenance:**
- Efficiency stays high
- Lifespan extends 3-5+ years
- Energy costs stay lower
- Breakdowns become rare
- You avoid emergency replacements

The math is simple: a few hours of maintenance over the years saves thousands in premature replacement costs.

## Tank Water Heater Maintenance

### 1. Annual Tank Flushing (Essential)

This is the single most important maintenance task for tank water heaters—and it's especially critical in Phoenix's hard water.

**Why it matters:**
Minerals in hard water precipitate out when heated and settle at the bottom of the tank as sediment. Over time, this sediment:
- Insulates the burner from the water (gas heaters), wasting energy
- Buries heating elements (electric heaters), causing overheating
- Reduces tank capacity
- Causes rumbling and popping sounds
- Accelerates tank deterioration

**DIY flushing process:**

1. **Turn off the heat source:**
   - Gas: Turn the gas control to "pilot" or "vacation"
   - Electric: Turn off the breaker

2. **Connect a hose to the drain valve** at the bottom of the tank. Run the hose to a drain or outside.

3. **Turn off the cold water supply** to the water heater.

4. **Open the drain valve** and let water flow out. It will be hot—be careful.

5. **Open a hot water faucet** somewhere in the house to allow air into the system.

6. **Let water drain** until it runs clear. If heavily sediment-laden, you may need to briefly turn the cold water back on to stir up remaining sediment.

7. **Close the drain valve,** turn on the cold water supply, and wait for the tank to fill (listen for water running into the tank; it will stop when full).

8. **Turn the heat source back on** once the tank is full. Don't turn on the heat with an empty tank—it will damage the unit.

9. **Check for leaks** at the drain valve.

**Frequency:** Annually at minimum. Every 6 months if you have very hard water or notice sediment when you flush.

**Pro tip:** If the drain valve is plastic or won't close properly after flushing, have it replaced with a ball-type drain valve—a small investment that makes future maintenance easier.

### 2. Test the T&P Relief Valve (Annual)

The Temperature and Pressure (T&P) relief valve is a critical safety device. If pressure or temperature gets too high, this valve opens to prevent the tank from becoming a bomb. Yes, really.

**Testing process:**

1. Place a bucket under the discharge pipe or ensure it's routed to a drain
2. Lift the lever on the T&P valve briefly
3. Water should flow freely
4. Release the lever—flow should stop completely

**What the results mean:**
- Water flows when lifted, stops when released: Valve is working
- No water flows: Valve may be stuck or blocked—replace it
- Water continues after releasing: Valve is failing—replace it
- Water dribbles or leaks after testing: Valve may need replacement

**When to call a pro:** If the valve doesn't function properly, have it replaced. This is a safety device, not something to ignore.

**Frequency:** Once per year

### 3. Check the Anode Rod (Every 2-3 Years)

The anode rod is a sacrificial metal rod inside the tank that corrodes instead of the tank itself. It's designed to be consumed over time—that's how it protects your tank. Once it's depleted, the tank becomes vulnerable to corrosion.

**Checking the anode rod:**

1. Turn off the heat source
2. Locate the anode rod port on top of the tank (usually a hexagonal fitting)
3. Use a 1-1/16" socket to remove the anode rod
4. Inspect the rod

**Signs the rod needs replacement:**
- Less than 1/2" of core wire remaining
- Rod is heavily corroded or pitted
- Rod has broken into segments

**Replacement timing:**
- Hard water areas (like Phoenix): Every 3-4 years
- Soft water areas: Every 4-5 years
- Water softener installed: Every 2-3 years (softened water is more aggressive on anodes)

**DIY feasibility:** This can be DIY, but accessing and removing the rod can be challenging. Space above the tank is often limited, and the rod may be corroded in place. Many homeowners prefer professional inspection.

### 4. Inspect for Leaks and Corrosion (Monthly)

A quick visual inspection can catch problems early:

**Look for:**
- Water pooling around the base
- Rust stains on the tank or floor
- Corrosion on fittings and connections
- Water stains on walls or ceiling near the tank
- Rust-colored water from hot taps

**Listen for:**
- Popping or rumbling (sediment)
- Hissing (leak or relief valve)
- Whining (scale on elements—electric)

### 5. Check the Temperature Setting (Annually)

Most water heaters are set at 140°F from the factory. The Department of Energy recommends 120°F for most households.

**Why 120°F:**
- Reduces scalding risk
- Saves 3-5% on water heating costs
- Slows mineral buildup
- Still hot enough for cleaning and sanitation

**Exception:** If you have a dishwasher without a booster heater, you may need 140°F for proper sanitization.

**How to adjust:**
- Gas: Turn the dial on the gas control valve
- Electric: Adjust the thermostat behind the access panel (turn off power first!)

## Tankless Water Heater Maintenance

Tankless water heaters have different maintenance needs—but maintenance is arguably even more important because of their susceptibility to scale.

### 1. Annual Descaling (Essential in Phoenix)

Scale buildup inside a tankless heater's heat exchanger reduces flow, decreases efficiency, and can trigger error codes. In Phoenix's hard water, annual descaling is mandatory—not optional.

**Professional descaling involves:**
1. Shutting off water and power/gas
2. Connecting a pump and hoses to flush ports
3. Circulating food-grade descaling solution for 45-60 minutes
4. Flushing with clean water
5. Reconnecting and testing

**DIY possibility:** Tankless descaling kits are available ($100-$150) and the process is manageable for handy homeowners. However, the first time is best done professionally so you can learn the process.

**Cost:** Professional descaling typically costs $150-$250. Considering your tankless unit costs $1,500-$3,000+, annual descaling is cheap insurance.

**Warranty note:** Many tankless warranties require documented annual maintenance. Skip it at your own risk.

### 2. Clean the Air Filter (Every 6 Months)

Gas tankless units have an air intake filter that prevents dust and debris from entering the combustion chamber.

**Process:**
1. Locate the filter (usually behind a removable panel)
2. Remove and inspect
3. Vacuum or wash with water
4. Allow to dry completely before reinstalling

### 3. Clean the Water Filter (Every 6 Months)

Most tankless units have an inline water filter at the cold water inlet.

**Process:**
1. Turn off water supply
2. Remove filter housing
3. Clean the screen
4. Reinstall

### 4. Check for Error Codes

Tankless heaters display error codes when something's wrong. Check periodically for codes and address them promptly. Common codes indicate:

- Ignition failure
- Flame loss
- Overheating
- Flow sensor issues
- Scale buildup

Consult your manual for specific codes and meanings.

## Warning Signs Something's Wrong

### Immediate Attention Needed
- Water leaking from tank (tank failure imminent)
- Gas smell (safety emergency—evacuate and call gas company)
- Breaker trips repeatedly (electrical issue)
- T&P valve continuously discharging (pressure problem)

### Soon Attention Needed
- Rust-colored hot water (corrosion)
- Rumbling or popping sounds (sediment)
- Water not as hot as usual (element or thermostat)
- Takes longer to recover (efficiency loss)
- Pilot light won't stay lit (thermocouple)

### Monitor and Schedule Service
- Minor temperature fluctuations
- Slightly reduced flow
- Occasional popping sounds

## When to Replace Instead of Repair

Sometimes maintenance isn't enough. Consider replacement when:

**Tank water heaters:**
- Unit is over 10-12 years old AND having problems
- Tank is leaking (not fittings—the actual tank)
- Multiple components have failed
- Rust-colored water despite maintenance
- Repair cost exceeds 50% of replacement

**Tankless water heaters:**
- Unit is over 15-20 years old AND having problems
- Heat exchanger has failed
- Multiple error codes persist after service
- Efficiency has significantly declined

---

## Professional vs. DIY Maintenance

### DIY-Friendly Tasks
- Tank flushing (with proper precautions)
- T&P valve testing
- Temperature adjustment
- Visual inspections
- Filter cleaning (tankless)

### Better Left to Pros
- Anode rod inspection/replacement
- Tankless descaling (first time)
- Any gas-related work
- Electrical component testing
- Troubleshooting error codes

---

## The Bottom Line

Water heater maintenance isn't complicated, but it makes a significant difference. The investment is minimal:

- **Time:** 1-2 hours per year
- **Cost:** $0-$300 annually (professional service or DIY supplies)
- **Return:** 3-5 additional years of life, lower energy bills, fewer breakdowns

Compare that to an emergency water heater replacement: $1,500-$3,000+, scheduled around the disaster rather than your convenience.

A little maintenance today prevents a lot of problems tomorrow.
