# How Much Does Repiping Cost in Phoenix? Complete 2024 Pricing Guide

**Whole-house repiping is a major investment. Here's what Phoenix homeowners should expect to pay—and what affects the price.**

## The Straight Answer on Repiping Costs

If you're researching repiping costs, you want numbers. Here they are:

**Typical whole-house repipe cost in Phoenix:**
- Small home (under 1,500 sq ft): $4,000-$7,000
- Average home (1,500-2,500 sq ft): $6,000-$12,000
- Large home (2,500+ sq ft): $10,000-$20,000+

**Cost per fixture:**
- Budget estimate: $800-$1,500 per fixture
- Most homes have 8-15 fixtures

These are realistic ranges for complete water supply line replacement using PEX tubing, which has become the standard material in Phoenix. Your actual cost depends on numerous factors we'll explore below.

## What's Included in a Repipe?

A whole-house repipe replaces all water supply lines—the pipes that bring water to your fixtures. This typically includes:

**What IS included:**
- All hot and cold water supply lines
- New shut-off valves at each fixture
- Connection to existing main water line
- Connection to existing water heater
- Pressure testing
- Basic drywall patching where access holes were made
- Permit and inspection (required in most Phoenix-area jurisdictions)

**What is NOT typically included:**
- Drain/waste lines (that's a separate system)
- Water heater replacement
- Fixture replacement (faucets, toilets, etc.)
- Finish drywall work, texture, and painting
- Outdoor irrigation lines

## Factors That Affect Repipe Cost

### 1. Home Size and Number of Fixtures

The more fixtures you have, the more pipe required and more connections to make.

**Typical fixture count by home size:**
| Home Type | Typical Fixtures | Estimated Pipe Cost Range |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------|
| 2 bed/1 bath | 6-8 fixtures | $4,000-$6,000 |
| 3 bed/2 bath | 10-12 fixtures | $6,000-$9,000 |
| 4 bed/3 bath | 14-18 fixtures | $9,000-$14,000 |
| 5+ bed/4+ bath | 20+ fixtures | $14,000-$20,000+ |

### 2. Number of Stories

Two-story homes cost more to repipe than single-story homes because:

- More vertical runs required
- Harder to access pipes in upper floors
- May require more ceiling access holes
- Scaffolding or ladder work increases labor time

**Estimate:** Add 20-30% for two-story homes.

### 3. Foundation Type

**Slab foundation (most Phoenix homes):**
- Pipes typically run through attic and walls
- Relatively accessible
- Standard pricing applies

**Raised foundation/crawl space (some older areas):**
- Can be easier to access
- May reduce costs slightly

**Pipes currently in slab:**
- Older homes may have copper or polybutylene running through the slab
- Rerouting through attic and walls adds cost and complexity
- May require additional access points

### 4. Current Pipe Material

What you're replacing affects demolition time and disposal:

**Copper:** Heavier, requires more cutting, but often has salvage value
**Galvanized steel:** Heavy, corroded, difficult to remove
**Polybutylene:** Easy to remove, but disposal of this failed material adds cost
**CPVC:** Relatively easy to remove

### 5. Pipe Material for New Installation

**PEX (Cross-linked Polyethylene):** $0.50-$2.00 per linear foot
- Most common choice today
- Flexible, easy to install
- Resistant to freezing damage
- 25-year+ lifespan
- Three types: PEX-A (most flexible), PEX-B (standard), PEX-C (less flexible)

**Copper:** $2.00-$5.00 per linear foot
- Traditional material
- Longer track record
- Higher material and labor costs
- 50+ year lifespan
- Theft risk in some areas

**CPVC:** $0.50-$1.50 per linear foot
- Rigid plastic
- Lower cost than copper
- Becoming less common due to brittleness concerns

**Our recommendation:** PEX is the best value for most Phoenix homes. It's durable, efficient to install, and handles our hard water well.

### 6. Accessibility

How hard is it to reach your pipes?

**Easy access:** Open attic, accessible walls, minimal obstacles
**Moderate access:** Finished attic, some drywall removal needed
**Difficult access:** Cathedral ceilings, finished spaces, complex layout

Access difficulty can swing the price 20-40% in either direction.

### 7. Scope of Drywall Repair

Some companies include only basic patching. Others include full repair with texture matching. Clarify what's included:

**Basic patching:** Access holes covered with drywall patch (not painted)
**Full repair:** Patching, texture matching, and painting

Full repair typically adds $500-$2,000 depending on the number of access points.

### 8. Permit and Inspection

Phoenix and surrounding cities require permits for repiping. Permit costs vary:

- Phoenix: $50-$150
- Glendale: $75-$125
- Surprise: $50-$100
- Peoria: $60-$110

Always hire a contractor who pulls permits. Unpermitted work creates problems when selling your home.

## Why Repiping Costs What It Does

### Labor is the Biggest Factor

Repiping is labor-intensive. A typical whole-house repipe takes 2-4 days with a crew of 2-3 plumbers. Labor represents 60-70% of the total cost.

**What the crew is doing:**
- Planning the new pipe routing
- Creating access points (cutting into walls/ceilings)
- Removing old piping
- Installing new manifold and main lines
- Running individual lines to each fixture
- Making all connections
- Pressure testing the system
- Repairing access holes
- Cleaning up

### Material Costs

PEX tubing is affordable, but the project requires:

- 200-500+ feet of PEX tubing
- Manifold systems
- Fittings (crimp rings or expansion fittings)
- Shut-off valves
- Support brackets and hangers
- Insulation (in some areas)

Material costs typically run $1,000-$3,000 for an average home.

### Overhead and Profit

Licensed, insured contractors have significant overhead:

- Insurance (liability and workers' comp)
- Licensing and continuing education
- Vehicle and tool expenses
- Office and administrative costs
- Reasonable profit margin

Be wary of quotes significantly below market—they may indicate unlicensed work or cut corners.

## Signs You Need a Repipe

### Definite Repipe Indicators

- **Polybutylene pipes:** This material (used 1978-1995) fails unpredictably. Insurance companies often require replacement.
- **Failing galvanized pipes:** Corroded galvanized steel restricts flow and contaminates water.
- **Multiple pinhole leaks:** When copper pipes develop multiple leaks, it indicates system-wide corrosion.
- **Water quality issues:** Rust-colored water, metallic taste, or sediment indicates deteriorating pipes.

### Possible Repipe Indicators

- **Low water pressure:** May be pipe corrosion, but could also be other causes.
- **Single leak:** One leak doesn't necessarily mean system failure.
- **Age alone:** Copper can last 50+ years if water chemistry is favorable.

Get a professional assessment before assuming you need a full repipe. Sometimes spot repairs or partial replacement is sufficient.

## Repipe vs. Spot Repair

Not every pipe problem requires full replacement:

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Single leak in copper line | Spot repair ($150-$400) |
| Two leaks in same line | Replace that section ($400-$800) |
| Multiple leaks in different areas | Full repipe likely needed |
| Polybutylene present | Full repipe recommended |
| Galvanized with flow issues | Full repipe recommended |
| Copper over 40 years with problems | Assess for full repipe |

A thorough inspection helps determine the right scope.

## Getting Accurate Quotes

### What to Expect from a Professional Quote

A reputable plumber should:

1. **Inspect your current system** (not quote over the phone)
2. **Identify pipe material and routing**
3. **Count fixtures** and assess accessibility
4. **Provide a written quote** with clear scope
5. **Explain what's included** and what's not
6. **Pull permits** for the work
7. **Warranty their work** (typically 1-2 years labor, manufacturer warranty on materials)

### Red Flags in Quotes

- Phone quotes without inspection
- Significantly below-market prices
- No mention of permits
- No written contract
- Pressure to decide immediately
- Unusually fast timelines

### Questions to Ask

1. What's your licensing and insurance?
2. Do you pull permits?
3. What material will you use?
4. How many days will the job take?
5. What's included in drywall repair?
6. What warranty do you offer?
7. What happens if you find unexpected issues?
