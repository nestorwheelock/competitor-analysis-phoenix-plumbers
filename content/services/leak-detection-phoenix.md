## Types of Leaks We Detect

### Slab Leaks

Slab leaks are among the most serious—and most common—leak problems in Arizona homes. When water lines running beneath or through your concrete foundation develop leaks, the consequences can be severe.

**What causes slab leaks:**
- Copper pipe corrosion from Phoenix's hard water
- Pipe damage from shifting soil
- Poor original installation
- Electrolysis from improper grounding
- Abrasion from pipes rubbing against concrete
- Age-related deterioration

**Warning signs of a slab leak:**
- Unexplained increase in water bills
- Sound of running water when nothing is on
- Warm spots on floors (hot water line leak)
- Damp or wet carpet with no obvious source
- Cracks in foundation or walls
- Mold or mildew smell
- Low water pressure
- Water meter spinning when water is off

**How we detect slab leaks:**
Our technicians use a combination of electronic amplification, acoustic detection, and thermal imaging to locate leaks beneath concrete without unnecessary drilling or demolition. We can often pinpoint a leak to within inches of its actual location.

### Underground Pipe Leaks

Water lines running from the street to your home and irrigation lines throughout your property can develop leaks that are difficult to locate without professional equipment.

**Signs of underground leaks:**
- Wet spots in your yard that won't dry
- Unusually green patches of grass
- Sinkholes or soft spots in landscaping
- Decreased water pressure
- Higher than normal water bills
- Sound of running water outside

**How we detect underground leaks:**
We use tracer gas injection and listening equipment to locate leaks in buried pipes. By introducing a safe, inert gas into the pipe system and detecting where it escapes at the surface, we can pinpoint leak locations with minimal excavation.

### Hidden Pipe Leaks

Leaks inside walls, ceilings, and floors can cause extensive damage before becoming visible. By the time you see a water stain, the leak may have been active for weeks or months.

**Signs of hidden pipe leaks:**
- Water stains on ceilings or walls
- Peeling paint or wallpaper
- Warped or buckled flooring
- Musty or moldy odors
- Sounds of dripping inside walls
- Sudden decrease in water pressure

**How we detect hidden leaks:**
We use a combination of thermal imaging (infrared cameras), acoustic amplification, and moisture meters to locate leaks behind walls and under floors without cutting into your home unnecessarily.

### Pool and Spa Leaks

Arizona pools lose water to evaporation, but excessive water loss often indicates a leak in the pool shell, plumbing, or equipment.

**Signs your pool may be leaking:**
- Losing more than 1/4 inch of water per day
- Cracks in the pool deck
- Loose or falling tiles
- Soggy spots in yard near pool
- Algae growth despite proper chemical balance
- Air in the pump system

**How we detect pool leaks:**
We perform bucket tests to confirm leak presence, then use dye testing, pressure testing, and electronic detection to locate leaks in the pool structure and plumbing.

### Sewer Leaks

Leaking sewer lines waste water, contaminate soil, and can undermine your foundation. They're also health hazards that require prompt attention.

**Signs of sewer leaks:**
- Sewage odors in yard or basement
- Wet, smelly spots in landscaping
- Lush vegetation over sewer line path
- Pest problems (rodents, insects)
- Foundation issues near sewer line

**How we detect sewer leaks:**
Video camera inspection allows us to see inside your sewer line and identify cracks, joint failures, and other damage that allows sewage to escape.

## Our Detection Technology

### Electronic Leak Detection

Electronic amplification equipment increases the sound of escaping water thousands of times, allowing our technicians to "hear" leaks through concrete, soil, and other barriers. Different frequencies are used for different materials and pipe types.

**How it works:**
We place sensitive listening devices at various points around your property and systematically narrow down the leak location by listening for the sound of water escaping under pressure.

### Acoustic Detection

Similar to electronic detection, acoustic equipment amplifies the sound of leaks. Ground microphones and contact sensors pick up the distinct sound of water escaping from pipes, even through concrete slabs and soil.

**How it works:**
Our technicians "listen" along the pipe path, and the sound grows louder as we approach the leak location. This method is particularly effective for pressurized supply lines.

### Thermal Imaging

Infrared cameras detect temperature differences invisible to the naked eye. Leaking hot water lines appear as warm spots, while cold water leaks may appear cooler than surrounding materials.

**How it works:**
We scan walls, floors, and ceilings with thermal cameras, creating images that show temperature variations. Leak areas appear distinctly different from surrounding dry materials.

### Tracer Gas Detection

For leaks that are difficult to locate with other methods, we can inject a safe, non-toxic tracer gas into the pipe system. As the gas escapes at the leak point, sensitive detectors identify its presence at the surface.

**How it works:**
After isolating the suspect section of pipe, we inject tracer gas (typically a hydrogen/nitrogen mix) and use handheld detectors to find where it escapes—pinpointing the leak location.

### Moisture Meters

Electronic moisture meters detect elevated moisture levels in building materials. We use both pin-type and non-invasive meters to map moisture patterns and narrow down leak locations.

**How it works:**
By taking readings across walls, floors, and ceilings, we can identify areas with abnormally high moisture content, helping confirm leak locations and assess damage extent.

### Video Camera Inspection

For drain and sewer leaks, we insert waterproof cameras into pipes to visually inspect for cracks, breaks, and joint failures. This is the most direct way to identify sewer line problems.

**How it works:**
A flexible cable with a high-resolution camera is inserted into the pipe, transmitting live video to our monitor. We can see exactly what's happening inside and locate any damage.

## Our Detection Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment

We start by discussing your concerns and observations. When did you first notice problems? What symptoms have you observed? This information helps us target our detection efforts.

### Step 2: Meter Test

We check your water meter while all fixtures are off. If the meter is moving, you have an active leak somewhere in your system. This confirms a leak exists before we proceed with location efforts.

### Step 3: Systematic Detection

Using appropriate technology for your situation, we systematically narrow down the leak location. This may involve multiple methods depending on the suspected leak type and location.

### Step 4: Location Confirmation

Once we believe we've found the leak, we verify the location using additional methods or minimally invasive investigation. We want to be confident in the location before recommending repairs.

### Step 5: Report and Recommendations

We provide a detailed report of our findings, including the leak location, likely cause, and recommended repair options. If the leak is in a difficult location, we'll discuss the best approach to minimize damage.

## Why Arizona Homes Are Prone to Leaks

### Hard Water Corrosion

Phoenix water is among the hardest in the nation, containing high concentrations of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals. These minerals are corrosive to copper pipes, particularly from the inside out.

**How it affects your pipes:**
- Causes pinhole leaks in copper supply lines
- Accelerates corrosion at joints and fittings
- Creates scale buildup that restricts flow
- Shortens the lifespan of original plumbing

**What you can do:**
Water softeners reduce mineral content and slow corrosion. Regular plumbing inspections catch developing problems early.

### Soil Movement

Arizona's clay soils expand when wet and contract when dry. Monsoon seasons bring intense moisture followed by extreme drying. This cycle creates soil movement that stresses buried pipes.

**How it affects your pipes:**
- Causes pipe shifting and stress cracks
- Creates pressure on joints
- Can cause bellying in sewer lines
- Undermines pipe bedding

### Construction on Slab

Most Arizona homes are built on concrete slab foundations with water lines running beneath or through the slab. This common construction method creates unique leak risks.

**Why slabs are problematic:**
- Pipes are inaccessible without demolition
- Leaks can go undetected for extended periods
- Concrete contact can damage pipe coatings
- Limited options for repairs

### Hot Water Line Stress

Arizona's extreme heat means cold water lines often carry warm water, and hot water lines carry very hot water. This thermal stress, combined with hard water, accelerates pipe deterioration.

## The Cost of Ignoring Leaks

### Water Waste

Even a small leak wastes significant water. A pinhole leak losing just one drip per second wastes over 3,000 gallons per year. Larger leaks can add hundreds of dollars monthly to your water bill.

### Property Damage

Water damage from leaks includes:
- Drywall deterioration and collapse
- Wood rot in framing
- Flooring damage and warping
- Mold and mildew growth
- Paint and finish damage
- Personal property damage

### Mold Remediation

Mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours of water exposure. Professional mold remediation costs thousands of dollars and may require temporary relocation during treatment.

### Foundation Damage

Slab leaks can undermine your foundation, causing:
- Foundation cracks
- Uneven settling
- Door and window misalignment
- Structural instability
- Expensive foundation repairs

### Insurance Complications

Many insurance policies cover sudden leak damage but exclude gradual leaks or damage from deferred maintenance. Prompt detection and repair protect your coverage.

## After We Find the Leak

### Repair Options

Once we locate your leak, we'll discuss repair options:

**Spot Repair**
For localized damage in accessible areas, we can repair just the damaged section. This is often the most economical option when damage is limited.

**Pipe Rerouting**
For slab leaks, we may recommend rerouting the pipe around the leak rather than tunneling through concrete. This provides a new pipe path and may be more cost-effective than direct repair.

**Repiping**
If leaks are caused by deteriorating pipes (common in older homes), replacing all supply lines may be more economical than repeated repairs. This eliminates the source of future leaks.

**Epoxy Lining**
For some drain and sewer leaks, we can apply epoxy lining to seal cracks from the inside without excavation.

### Working with Insurance

If your leak has caused property damage, we can:
- Document our findings for your insurance claim
- Provide detailed reports and photos
- Coordinate with insurance adjusters
- Recommend restoration contractors
