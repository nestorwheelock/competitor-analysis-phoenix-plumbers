## Our Water Heater Services

### Water Heater Repair

When your water heater stops working, you notice immediately. No hot water for showers. Cold water for dishes. A disrupted household routine. Our repair technicians diagnose and fix water heater problems quickly, often in a single visit.

**Common water heater problems we repair:**

**No Hot Water**
The most obvious sign something's wrong. Causes range from simple thermostat adjustments to failed heating elements or gas control valves.

**Not Enough Hot Water**
Running out of hot water too quickly often indicates sediment buildup, a failing heating element (electric), or a unit that's undersized for your household's needs.

**Water Too Hot**
Dangerously hot water is usually a thermostat issue that's easy to fix but important to address promptly—water over 120°F can cause scalding.

**Strange Noises**
Rumbling, popping, or crackling sounds typically indicate sediment buildup on the tank bottom. Regular flushing and anode rod maintenance can prevent this.

**Leaking Water Heater**
Leaks can originate from valves, fittings, or the tank itself. Tank leaks often mean replacement is needed, but other leaks are usually repairable.

**Discolored or Smelly Water**
Rusty water suggests corrosion inside the tank. Rotten egg smell indicates bacteria in the tank, often addressable by flushing and adjusting the temperature.

**Pilot Light Problems (Gas)**
Gas water heaters can have issues with the pilot light, thermocouple, or gas control valve that prevent ignition.

### Water Heater Installation

Whether you're replacing a failed water heater or upgrading to a more efficient model, professional installation ensures safety, efficiency, and code compliance. We install all types and brands of water heaters.

**What's included in our installation:**
- Removal and disposal of old water heater
- Installation of new unit per manufacturer specifications
- All necessary permits and inspections
- Connection to existing plumbing and gas/electric
- Expansion tank installation (required by code)
- Temperature and pressure relief valve
- Seismic strapping (required in Arizona)
- System testing and instruction on operation
- Warranty registration

**We install these water heater types:**
- Traditional tank water heaters (gas and electric)
- Tankless (on-demand) water heaters
- Heat pump (hybrid) water heaters
- Point-of-use water heaters

- Inadequate hot water despite repairs
- Rising energy bills
- Significant sediment buildup

**Our replacement process:**
1. Assess your hot water needs
2. Recommend appropriate replacement options
3. Provide detailed written quote
4. Schedule convenient installation
5. Install and test new unit
6. Dispose of old unit properly
7. Provide warranty documentation

### Water Heater Maintenance

Regular maintenance extends water heater life, maintains efficiency, and prevents unexpected failures. Arizona's hard water makes maintenance especially important.

**Our maintenance service includes:**
- Tank flushing to remove sediment
- Anode rod inspection and replacement
- Temperature and pressure valve testing
- Thermostat calibration
- Burner and flame inspection (gas)
- Element testing (electric)
- Connection and fitting inspection
- Energy efficiency assessment

**Recommended maintenance schedule:**
- Annual professional inspection and flushing
- Anode rod check every 2-3 years
- Anode rod replacement every 4-5 years (sooner in hard water)

## Types of Water Heaters

### Traditional Tank Water Heaters

Tank water heaters store and continuously heat 30-80 gallons of water, ready for use whenever you need it. They're the most common type, with lower upfront costs and simpler installation.

**Pros:**
- Lower purchase price
- Simpler installation
- Works with any flow rate
- Familiar technology
- Easy repairs

**Cons:**
- Higher operating costs
- Limited hot water supply
- Larger footprint
- Standby heat loss
- Shorter lifespan in hard water

**Best for:**
- Budget-conscious homeowners
- Homes with moderate hot water needs
- Situations requiring simple replacement

**Gas vs. Electric:**
Gas tank water heaters cost more upfront but less to operate, recovering hot water faster than electric models. Electric models are simpler with fewer components that can fail.

### Tankless (On-Demand) Water Heaters

Tankless water heaters heat water only when needed, eliminating standby heat loss and providing endless hot water. While more expensive upfront, they offer lower operating costs and longer lifespans.

**Pros:**
- Endless hot water
- 20-30% more energy efficient
- Longer lifespan (20+ years)
- Compact size
- Lower operating costs
- Reduced mineral buildup

**Cons:**
- Higher upfront cost
- May require electrical or gas upgrades
- Flow rate limitations
- More complex installation
- Higher repair costs

**Best for:**
- Larger families with high hot water demand
- Homes with space constraints
- Long-term homeowners
- Those prioritizing efficiency

**Sizing considerations:**
Tankless water heaters are sized by flow rate (gallons per minute) and temperature rise. In Phoenix, where incoming water is relatively warm, you may be able to use a smaller unit than in colder climates.

### Heat Pump (Hybrid) Water Heaters

Heat pump water heaters use electricity to move heat from the surrounding air into the water, making them 2-3 times more efficient than conventional electric water heaters.

**Pros:**
- Highest efficiency available
- Lowest operating costs
- Utility rebates often available
- Dehumidifies surrounding area
- Long lifespan

**Cons:**
- Highest upfront cost
- Requires warm air space (ideal for Arizona)
- Slower recovery time
- Requires more installation space
- May need air circulation modifications

**Best for:**
- Arizona homes (abundant warm air)
- Environmentally conscious homeowners
- Those seeking lowest operating costs
- Garages or utility rooms with space

### Solar Water Heaters

Arizona's abundant sunshine makes solar water heating viable for many homeowners. These systems use solar collectors to heat water, significantly reducing energy costs.

**Types of solar water heaters:**
- Active systems with circulating pumps
- Passive systems (simpler, less efficient)
- Batch collectors (simple, integrated design)
- Evacuated tube collectors (most efficient)

**Best for:**
- Homeowners committed to renewable energy
- Properties with good southern exposure
- Long-term homeowners
- Those seeking energy independence

## Water Heater Issues Specific to Arizona

### Hard Water Damage

Phoenix water is among the hardest in the nation, containing high levels of calcium and magnesium that wreak havoc on water heaters. These minerals:

- Accumulate on tank bottoms, reducing efficiency
- Coat heating elements, causing premature failure
- Clog tankless heat exchangers
- Accelerate anode rod depletion
- Reduce water heater lifespan by years

**Our solutions:**
- More frequent tank flushing (every 6-12 months)
- Proactive anode rod replacement
- Water softener recommendations
- Tankless system descaling
- Scale-resistant water heater models

### Extreme Heat Impact

Arizona summers subject outdoor and garage water heaters to extreme temperatures that can:

- Overheat water beyond safe levels
- Stress tank components
- Affect thermostat accuracy
- Reduce insulation effectiveness

**Our solutions:**
- Proper thermostat adjustment for seasonal changes
- Insulation blankets for garage units
- Shading recommendations for outdoor installations
- Heat-resistant installation practices

### Energy Efficiency in Arizona

While Arizona's warm climate means water heaters don't work as hard to maintain temperature, the cooling season presents opportunities:

- Heat pump water heaters excel in Arizona's warm climate
- Solar water heating potential is among the highest in the nation
- Proper insulation prevents heat gain from water heaters in summer

## Choosing the Right Water Heater

### Sizing Your Water Heater

**For tank water heaters:**
The "first hour rating" indicates how much hot water a unit delivers in the first hour of use. Choose based on your peak demand:

| Household Size | First Hour Rating |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 1-2 people | 30-40 gallons |
| 2-3 people | 40-50 gallons |
| 3-4 people | 50-60 gallons |
| 5+ people | 60-80 gallons |

**For tankless water heaters:**
Size based on flow rate (GPM) needed for simultaneous use:

| Fixtures in Use | Flow Rate Needed |
|----------------|------------------|
| One shower | 2.0 GPM |
| Two showers | 4.0 GPM |
| Shower + dishwasher | 3.5 GPM |
| Whole house | 5-8 GPM |

### Fuel Type Considerations

**Natural Gas:**
- Lower operating costs
- Faster recovery time
- Works during power outages
- Requires gas line and venting
- Higher installation cost if not existing

**Electric:**
- Lower installation cost
- No venting required
- Higher operating costs
- Simpler maintenance
- Works anywhere with electricity

**Propane:**
- Option for homes without natural gas
- Similar benefits to natural gas
- Requires propane tank and delivery
- Higher fuel costs than natural gas

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long do water heaters last?

Tank water heaters typically last 8-12 years, though Arizona's hard water often shortens this to 6-10 years without proper maintenance. Tankless water heaters last 15-20+ years with regular descaling.

### Should I repair or replace my water heater?

Generally, repair if:
- Unit is less than 8 years old
- Repair cost is less than 50% of replacement
- Problem is isolated (not tank failure)

Replace if:
- Unit is over 10 years old
- Tank is leaking
- Frequent repairs needed
- Energy bills are rising
- Inadequate hot water persists

### How do I know what size water heater I need?

For tank water heaters, match the first-hour rating to your peak demand (usually morning). A family of four typically needs a 50-gallon tank. For tankless, calculate the total GPM of fixtures you'll use simultaneously.

### Is a tankless water heater worth the extra cost?

For many Phoenix homeowners, yes. The 20-30% energy savings, endless hot water, and 20+ year lifespan often justify the higher upfront cost, especially if you plan to stay in your home long-term.

### Why does my water heater make noise?

Popping, rumbling, or crackling sounds usually indicate sediment buildup on the tank bottom. The sounds occur as water trapped under sediment boils. Professional flushing resolves this and improves efficiency.

### How often should I flush my water heater?

In Arizona's hard water, we recommend flushing annually—every 6 months for homes without water softeners. Regular flushing removes sediment and extends water heater life.

### What temperature should I set my water heater?

120°F is recommended for most households—hot enough for comfort but not scalding. Higher settings waste energy and increase scalding risk. We can adjust your thermostat during service visits.
