## Toilet Services

### Toilet Repair

A malfunctioning toilet isn't just annoying—it can waste thousands of gallons of water per month. A running toilet can lose 200+ gallons daily, adding significantly to your water bill while stressing your plumbing system.

**Common toilet problems we repair:**

**Running Toilet**
The most common toilet complaint. Causes include worn flappers, faulty fill valves, improper float adjustment, and sediment buildup. Most running toilets can be fixed in under an hour.

**Toilet Won't Flush Properly**
Weak flushes, incomplete flushes, and toilets that require multiple flushes to clear waste may have clogged rim jets, a faulty flapper, low water level, or a partial blockage.

**Toilet Keeps Clogging**
Frequent clogs can indicate problems beyond simple blockages—partial sewer line obstructions, buildup in the trap, or a toilet that's undersized for the household's needs.

**Toilet Leaking at Base**
Water pooling around the base indicates a failed wax ring seal between the toilet and the flange. This needs prompt repair to prevent subfloor damage and unhealthy conditions.

**Phantom Flushing**
When your toilet seems to flush by itself, it's actually slowly leaking from the tank to the bowl. This "phantom flush" wastes water and indicates a failing flapper or flush valve.

**Toilet Tank Sweating**
In humid conditions, cold water in the tank causes condensation on the outside—dripping onto your floor. Tank insulation kits or mixing valves can eliminate this problem.

**Loose or Rocking Toilet**
A toilet that moves when you sit isn't just uncomfortable—it's breaking the wax seal and will eventually leak. We can reset and secure the toilet properly.

### Toilet Installation

Whether you're replacing a failing toilet or upgrading for better performance and efficiency, professional installation ensures proper function and code compliance.

**What's included in our toilet installation:**
- Removal and disposal of old toilet
- Inspection of flange condition
- Wax ring and mounting hardware
- Installation of new toilet per manufacturer specs
- Connection to water supply
- Testing for proper function and leaks
- Caulking around base (optional)
- Operation instruction

**Toilet types we install:**
- Two-piece toilets (most common)
- One-piece toilets
- Wall-mounted toilets
- Comfort height/ADA compliant
- Dual-flush toilets
- High-efficiency toilets (HET)
- Smart toilets with bidets

**Toilet recommendations for Arizona:**
We typically recommend WaterSense-labeled toilets that use 1.28 gallons per flush or less. In Phoenix's drought-prone climate, water efficiency matters. Popular brands include Kohler, TOTO, American Standard, and Gerber.

## Faucet Services

### Faucet Repair

A dripping faucet wastes up to 3,000 gallons of water per year—and that constant drip-drip-drip can drive anyone crazy. Most faucet problems have straightforward fixes when addressed by a professional.

**Common faucet problems we repair:**

**Dripping Faucet**
Usually caused by worn washers, O-rings, or cartridges. The fix depends on your faucet type (compression, ball, cartridge, or ceramic disc), but all are repairable.

**Leaking Under Sink**
Leaks at supply line connections, the faucet base, or the sprayer hose can damage cabinets and encourage mold growth. We identify and repair the source.

**Low Water Pressure**
Restricted flow often results from mineral buildup in aerators or cartridges—common in Phoenix's hard water. Cleaning or replacement restores normal flow.

**Faucet Handle Problems**
Handles that are hard to turn, won't stay in position, or feel loose indicate worn internal parts that need replacement.

**Hot/Cold Reversed or Inconsistent**
Cartridge problems can cause temperature control issues. Replacement is usually straightforward.

**Sprayer Won't Work**
Kitchen sprayer problems usually involve the diverter valve, hose, or sprayer head itself.

### Faucet Installation

Upgrading faucets improves both function and appearance. New faucets offer better water efficiency, improved ergonomics, and modern styling.

**What's included in our faucet installation:**
- Removal of old faucet
- Inspection of supply lines
- Installation of new faucet per manufacturer specs
- New supply line connections (recommended)
- Testing for proper function and leaks
- Garbage disposal connection (kitchen)
- Operation instruction

**Faucet types we install:**
- Kitchen faucets (single-hole, three-hole, wall-mount)
- Pull-down and pull-out spray faucets
- Pot filler faucets
- Bathroom sink faucets
- Tub and shower faucets
- Touchless/sensor faucets

**Popular brands we install:**
Moen, Delta, Kohler, Pfister, Grohe, American Standard, and others. We can install customer-supplied faucets or help you select the right faucet for your needs.

## Garbage Disposal Services

### Garbage Disposal Repair

Garbage disposals are workhorses that handle a lot of abuse, but they do require occasional maintenance and repair. Many problems have simple solutions.

**Common garbage disposal problems we repair:**

**Disposal Won't Turn On**
Often a reset button trip or electrical issue. If reset doesn't work, the problem may be the switch, wiring, or a failed motor.

**Humming But Not Spinning**
This usually indicates a jam. Something is stuck preventing the grinding plate from turning. We can clear jams and get your disposal working again.

**Leaking Disposal**
Leaks can occur at the sink flange, dishwasher connection, or discharge pipe. We identify the source and make appropriate repairs.

**Poor Grinding Performance**
Dull impellers or worn grinding components reduce effectiveness. Sometimes sharpening (running ice) helps; sometimes replacement is needed.

**Strange Noises**
Grinding noises, rattling, or metallic sounds often indicate foreign objects in the disposal or failing components.

**Disposal Drains Slowly**
Partial clogs in the disposal or drain pipe restrict water flow. Professional clearing restores normal drainage.

**Foul Odors**
Food buildup in the disposal creates unpleasant odors. We can clean the disposal and recommend maintenance practices.

### Garbage Disposal Installation

New disposals offer improved grinding power, quieter operation, and better reliability than older models. We install all major brands and can help you choose the right model.

**What's included in our disposal installation:**
- Removal and disposal of old unit
- Inspection of drain connections
- Installation of new disposal per manufacturer specs
- Electrical connections (if existing)
- Dishwasher connection (if applicable)
- Testing for proper function and leaks
- Operation instruction

**Disposal types we install:**
- Continuous feed disposals (most common)
- Batch feed disposals (safer operation)
- Compact disposals (smaller kitchens)
- Heavy-duty disposals (large households)
- Septic-safe disposals

**Our recommendations:**
For most households, we recommend a 1/2 HP to 3/4 HP disposal. InSinkErator, Waste King, and Moen are reliable brands. In homes with septic systems, we'll recommend septic-safe models and discuss usage guidelines.

## The Benefits of Upgrading Fixtures

### Water Efficiency

Modern fixtures use significantly less water than older models:

| Fixture | Old Standard | WaterSense Standard | Annual Savings |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Toilet | 3.5-7 GPF | 1.28 GPF | 8,000+ gallons |
| Faucet | 2.2 GPM | 1.5 GPM | 700+ gallons |
| Showerhead | 2.5 GPM | 2.0 GPM | 2,700+ gallons |

In Phoenix's desert climate, water efficiency isn't just about saving money—it's about responsible resource use.

### Improved Performance

New fixtures often work better than old ones:
- Toilets that flush completely the first time
- Faucets with smooth temperature control
- Showerheads that maintain pressure while using less water
- Garbage disposals that grind faster and quieter

### Enhanced Appearance

Updated fixtures modernize your bathrooms and kitchen without major renovation. Coordinated finishes (brushed nickel, oil-rubbed bronze, matte black, chrome) create a polished look.

### Increased Home Value

Updated plumbing fixtures are a selling point. Buyers appreciate modern, efficient fixtures that won't need immediate replacement.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does toilet repair cost?

Most toilet repairs range from $100-$250, depending on the problem. Flapper replacement is on the lower end; complete internal rebuilds are higher. Replacement toilets start around $300-$500 installed.

### Should I repair or replace my old faucet?

If your faucet is less than 10 years old and the repair cost is under 50% of replacement cost, repair usually makes sense. Older faucets or those requiring expensive parts are often better replaced.

### Can any faucet work with any sink?

Not necessarily. Faucets must match the number and spacing of holes in your sink. Single-hole, three-hole, and widespread configurations aren't interchangeable without modification.

### How long do garbage disposals last?

With proper use, garbage disposals last 8-12 years. Frequent jams, grinding non-food items, or running without water shortens lifespan.

### Why does my toilet keep running?

The most common cause is a worn flapper that doesn't seal properly. Fill valve problems, float misadjustment, and overflow tube issues can also cause running.

### Can you install a fixture I purchased?

Yes, we install customer-supplied fixtures. We recommend purchasing from a reputable retailer to ensure warranty coverage and authentic products.

### Do you offer warranties on fixtures?

We warranty our installation work. Fixtures carry the manufacturer's warranty, which we can help you register and understand.
