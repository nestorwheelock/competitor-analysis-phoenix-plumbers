## What Qualifies as a Plumbing Emergency?

Not every plumbing problem requires emergency service, but many do. If you're dealing with any of these situations, don't wait—call us immediately:

### Situations That Require Immediate Attention

**Active Water Leaks**
Water spraying from a pipe, pooling on your floor, or streaming down your walls requires immediate professional attention. Every minute a leak continues, more water damages your home's structure, flooring, drywall, and belongings. A small leak can release 5-10 gallons per minute, which adds up to hundreds of gallons of damage in just an hour.

**Burst or Frozen Pipes**
While frozen pipes are less common in Phoenix than in colder climates, they can still occur during winter cold snaps, especially in unprotected outdoor pipes or poorly insulated areas. When a pipe bursts, you need immediate repair to prevent flooding and structural damage.

**Sewer Line Backups**
When sewage backs up into your home through drains, toilets, or bathtub, you're facing both a plumbing emergency and a health hazard. Raw sewage contains dangerous bacteria and pathogens that can make your family sick. We respond immediately to clear blockages and sanitize affected areas.

**Complete Drain Blockages**
If all the drains in your home are backing up simultaneously, you likely have a main line clog that requires professional equipment to clear. Attempting to use chemical drain cleaners can make the problem worse and damage your pipes.

**Gas Leaks**
If you smell rotten eggs or hear hissing near gas lines, evacuate your home immediately and call 911. Once you're safely away from the property, call us to locate and repair the leak. Gas leaks are extremely dangerous and require licensed professionals to repair.

**No Hot Water**
While not always an emergency, losing hot water can be urgent—especially if you have young children, elderly family members, or medical needs that require hot water. We respond quickly to diagnose and repair water heater failures.

**Overflowing Toilet**
A toilet that won't stop overflowing can quickly flood your bathroom and adjacent rooms with contaminated water. If your toilet is actively overflowing and the shutoff valve isn't stopping it, call us immediately.

**Flooding from Any Source**
Whether it's a failed washing machine hose, a broken water supply line, or a malfunctioning water heater, any flooding situation requires immediate professional intervention.

## What to Do While Waiting for the Plumber

### For Water Emergencies:

1. **Locate your main water shutoff valve.** It's typically near your water meter or where the main line enters your home. Turn it clockwise to shut off water to your entire house.

2. **Turn off the water heater.** If you've shut off the main water supply, turn off your water heater to prevent damage from heating an empty tank.

3. **Open faucets to drain remaining water.** This relieves pressure in the pipes and drains water that's already in the system.

4. **Move valuables away from water.** If water is pooling, move furniture, electronics, and personal items to dry areas.

5. **Document the damage.** Take photos and videos for insurance purposes.

### For Sewer Backups:

1. **Stop using water.** Every flush or drain use adds to the backup problem.

2. **Keep children and pets away.** Sewage contains harmful bacteria and pathogens.

3. **Open windows for ventilation.** Sewer gases can be harmful in enclosed spaces.

4. **Don't use chemical drain cleaners.** They won't clear a main line clog and can make the situation worse.

### For Gas Leaks:

1. **Evacuate immediately.** Get everyone out of the house, including pets.

2. **Don't flip any switches.** Electrical sparks can ignite gas.

3. **Don't use your phone inside.** Cell phones can create sparks.

4. **Call 911 from a safe distance.** Let the fire department ensure the area is safe.

5. **Then call us for repairs.** Once the area is cleared, we can locate and repair the leak.
