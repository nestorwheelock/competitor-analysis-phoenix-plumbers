## Sun City West Considerations

### Aging Plumbing Systems
Homes built in the late 1970s-1990s may have:
- Copper pipes affected by hard water
- Original water heaters past their lifespan
- Older fixtures needing replacement

### Hard Water Impact
Sun City West water is hard, causing scale buildup in pipes and appliances. Regular maintenance extends system life.
