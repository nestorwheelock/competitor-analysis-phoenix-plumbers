## Understanding Sun City Plumbing

### Original Plumbing Systems

Many Sun City homes still have original plumbing from the 1960s-1980s, including:
- **Galvanized steel supply lines** – Prone to corrosion and restricted flow
- **Cast iron sewer lines** – Durable but eventually corrode
- **Original water heaters** – Well past expected lifespan
- **Older fixtures** – Less water-efficient, harder to find parts

We specialize in working with these systems, providing repairs when possible and honest advice about replacement when necessary.

### Common Issues We Address

- Reduced water pressure from corroded pipes
- Sewer line roots and deterioration
- Water heater failures
- Fixture leaks and malfunctions
- Slab leak detection and repair
