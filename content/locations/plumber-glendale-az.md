## Common Glendale Plumbing Issues

### Older Home Challenges

Historic Glendale and the neighborhoods surrounding downtown often have homes built in the 1940s-1970s with original plumbing. Common issues include:
- Galvanized steel pipes that rust and restrict flow
- Cast iron sewer lines with corrosion and root infiltration
- Outdated fixtures that waste water
- Polybutylene pipes (gray plastic) prone to failure

We specialize in updating these older systems while respecting the character of vintage homes.

### Hard Water Impact

Like all Phoenix-area communities, Glendale water is extremely hard. This affects:
- Water heater efficiency and lifespan
- Fixture performance and appearance
- Appliance longevity
- Pipe scale accumulation
