## Pain Points (From Negative Reviews)

These are issues mentioned in negative/neutral reviews - valuable for identifying service gaps:

### The Plumber Guy (2.0/5)
> "The service tech was great. However the price I was quoted was outrageous. I needed 2 tankless water heaters replaced. I was quoted $5500 per unit. So $11000.00 total. The plumbing is already there, the electric is already there. I found my exact unit online for $695. I’m having another plumber install them for $250. The service call was $265 for the tech to come out and unscrew the front panel, look at them and say “yup, they need to be replaced”.  I understand things are crazy with this economy, but I feel like I’ve been had."
*- michelle roman*

### Copper State Plumbing Services LLC (1.0/5)
> "We had a service call scheduled through our home warranty and they gave a 5 hour window. My husband and I re-arranged out schedules to make sure someoneon would be home. At 5:00 no one had shown or called. My husband called right after 5 and no answer and he left a message. I called the next morning and not answer.  If you want someone to actually show up don&#x27;t call them.

This review is for Copper State Plumbing Services LLC.  The state of Arizona doesn&#x27;t allow multiple companies to have the same business name."
*- Vinesa Gomez*

### Copper State Plumbing Services LLC (1.0/5)
> "NEVER CALL THIS COMPANY!!
I was assigned to this company through my awesome home warranty and I had emergency water leak after 4 phone calls where I left urgent message never ever hear a peep from them.
Complaint with better business owner aswell as complaint through the home warranty has been made .extremely unprofessional and out right Rude to not even follow up with a new customer with an urgent need ..
Company&#x27;s like this disgust me !!!"
