## 1. Strategic Objective

### 1.1 The Goal

The objective is not to "publish content," but to **systematically capture search demand** across three dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Captures | Example Pages |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Services** | What people need | Water heater repair, drain cleaning |
| **Locations** | Where they need it | Plumber Surprise AZ, Plumber Waddell AZ |
| **Problems** | How they describe it | No hot water, running toilet, sewer smell |

**Target:** Move from partial topical authority to **dominant topical authority** within the Phoenix plumbing market.

### 1.2 Market Position

| Metric | Market Reality | Our Target |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Competitors | 122 tracked | Top 25% |
| Avg Rating | 4.84/5.0 | 4.9+ |
| Elite (4.9+) | 71% of market | Match |
| Avg Reviews | 676 | 100+ (Year 1) |
| Sites with 30+ pages | 20 competitors | Match/Exceed |

### 1.3 Competitive Positioning

| Strategy | Target | Investment | Timeline |
|----------|--------|------------|----------|
| **Niche Specialist** | Specific service (tankless, drain) | Low | 6-12 months |
| **Geographic Dominator** | Specific ZIP codes (Waddell, Litchfield) | Medium | 12-18 months |
| **Full-Service Challenger** | Broad market | High | 24+ months |

**Recommended:** Start as Geographic Dominator in underserved markets (Waddell, Litchfield Park, Avondale), then expand.

### 1.4 Differentiation Strategy

Based on competitor analysis, differentiate through:

1. **ROC License prominence** - 69% of competitors don't display theirs
2. **Site speed** - Market avg mobile score is 55, target 90+
3. **Location-specific content** - Underserved: Litchfield Park, Waddell, Avondale
4. **Emergency service focus** - High-intent, transactional keywords
5. **Trust signals** - Video testimonials, team photos, certifications
